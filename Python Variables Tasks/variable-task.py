#1. create a Boolean Variable named x

x = True

#2 create an integer variable named y

y = 4


#3. creat a float variable named z

z = 4.3

#4. creat a String varibale named s

s = 'Python Varibale'


#5. convert the int variable to float


a = 3
b = float(a)

#6. Can we convert the str to int ?

print('yes we can ,if the string is just a numbers without letters')

    #example :

num = '10'
  
    # check and print type num variable
print(type(num)) 
  
    # convert the num into string 
converted_num = int(num)
  
    # print type of converted_num
print(type(converted_num))
  
    # We can check by doing some mathematical operations
print(converted_num + 20)


#7. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 5

l = [1,2,3,4,5]

#8. Create a tuple from 10 to 15

tu = (10,11,12,13,14,15)

#9. Convert the list to tuple


convert_l = tuple(l)


#10. Create a dict of 3 values

d ={1 : 'html' ,2 : 'css' , 3 : 'js'}

#11. Can we use semi colon; with python 

print('yes ,we use semicolon when we write more than one code at the same line')

    #example :

print("hello");print("test");var="welcome"

#12. Python is interpreted or compiled ?

print('Python is Interpreted')

#13. What is the differences between low level & high level


'''
Low level :


It consists of 1 , 0
It is easy to be Executed
It is hard to program
It is machine-dependent.
It needs assembler for translation.



High level :


Easy to program
Takes less time to be coded
Easy to be corrected
Portable
It can run on any platform.
It needs compiler or interpreter for translation.
Like java ,python
