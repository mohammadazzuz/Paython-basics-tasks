'''
1. What is the differences between = , ==

-   = is an assignment operator.

-   == is an equality operator.

    x=15
    y=25
    z=25

    (x==y) is False
    (y==z) is True
'''

'''
2. What do we mean by using !=

-  check if the value of two operands is not equal

    x=15 , y=25     (x != y) = True
'''

'''
3. What is opertor precedence

    -Order Of Operations

    Barckets : ()
    Exponent : **
    Division : /
    Multiplication : *
    Addition : +
    Subtraction : -

-   example

      (6+2**2)/2+(6*3+8/2)

    _ (6+2**2)/2
    
    - 2**2 = 4 , 6+4 = 10 , 10/2 = 5 

    _ (6*3+8/2)

    - 8/2 = 4 , 6*3 = 18 , 4+18 = 22

    _ 5+22 = 27

#4. Create a variable x with value of 10 

x = 10

#5. Incease x vlue by 15 using assignment operators

x = x+5

#6. Dvide the x value by 5 using assignment operators

x = x/5

#7. Multily the x value by 10 using assignment operator

x = x*10

#8. Get module of x on 3 using assignment operators

x = x%3


#9. Using pgthon print the module of 11 to 4

print(11%4)

#10. Print the exponent of 2,3

print(2*3)

#11. Divide 11 by 3 using python division

a = 11
b = 3
z = a/b

print(z)

#12. Can we divide by 3 and get an integer number ?

print('using //')
print(a//b)
